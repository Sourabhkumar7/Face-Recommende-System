I have successful completed my project: Celebrity  recommendation system that combines advanced deep learning techniques with a user-friendly interface.



Pretrained Models: Leveraged state-of-the-art models such as VGG and ResNet-50 to build the foundation of the system.



Extensive Training Dataset: Utilized a large and diverse dataset of celebrity photos to extract detailed features and ensure comprehensive training.



User Photo Processing: When users upload their photos, the system processes them in real-time, training and testing the images to ensure accuracy.



Cosine Similarity Matching: Implemented cosine similarity to compare the uploaded photo against the dataset, accurately identifying and returning the closest celebrity match.



Interactive User Interface: Used Streamlit to create a user-friendly interface, allowing users to easily upload their photos and receive results.



Technologies: Employed TensorFlow and Keras for model building and training, ensuring robust and scalable performance.



Valuable Learning Experience: This project provided deep insights into managing large datasets, fine-tuning machine learning models, and achieving high accuracy in predictions.
